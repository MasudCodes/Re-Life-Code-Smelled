An organized lifestyle can enable people to focus more on what they want to achieve. It helps to make better decisions at work and in Personal life. The goal of our application is to make peopleâ€™s daily life easier and invoke a sense of order in their daily routine. In making this app we hope to achieve the following.

Better time management: Everyone has a bit of chaos in their daily life. Hence, our application will hopes to organize or prioritize the daily chores for each user on a personalized level. By organizing daily tasks users can get more work to done and therefore have more time.
Keep record of daily expenses: Our application will help to record and keep track of expenses for each user, boiling down to their daily expenses. This allows users to keep their daily expenses under budget.
Statistical view: Our application will give a statistical estimate of the users mental and financial state. Users can select what kind of mood they are having today. For an example, the user can select happy, sad, crying. Based on this data, our application will give a statistical view of their sentiment over the course of a given time, and prompt suggestions and tips accordingly. Besides this, it will be able to show statistical view of the financial state as well.
